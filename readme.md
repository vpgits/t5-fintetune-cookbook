# SQuAD Question and Answer Generation

This repository contains Jupyter notebooks for generating questions, answers, and context-based questions and answers using the Stanford Question Answering Dataset (SQuAD). The notebooks demonstrate how to work with the SQuAD dataset and generate natural language questions and answers.

## Notebooks

1. **Question Generation**: This notebook focuses on generating questions from given text passages. It uses the SQuAD dataset to fine-tune a model for question generation.

2. **Answer Generation**: In this notebook, you can generate answers to questions based on a given context. It uses pre-trained models to identify answers within the context.

3. **Context-Based QA**: The context-based question and answer generation notebook combines the previous two functionalities. Given a context, it generates questions and answers. This is particularly useful for tasks like question-answering chatbots.
